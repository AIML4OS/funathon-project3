# Sentinel-2 Images

This section describes how Sentinel-2 images are retrieved, visualised, and organised for model training.  

Explanations (what is a satellite image ?), other images, copernicus webapp...  

1. Data acquisition  
  Download a Sentinel-2 image for a given bounding box (bbox) and acquisition date, specifying:  
    - spatial extent (bbox coordinates and CRS),
    - acquisition date range,
    - selected spectral bands,
    - output file format.

2. Visualisation  
  Plot the downloaded Sentinel-2 image (e.g. RGB composition) to verify spatial coverage and data integrity.

3. Training dataset structure  
  Discover the directory structure containing all Sentinel-2 images used for training.

4. Automation **optional**  
  Provide the reproducible code to automatically download all Sentinel-2 images required for the training dataset.

# CLCPlus Labels

This section describes how CLCPlus land-cover labels are retrieved, visualised, and aligned with Sentinel-2 images.  

Explanations (what is a segmentation mask for satellite image ?), other labels, copernicus webapp...  

1. Label acquisition  
  Download CLCPlus labels for the same bounding box and a specified release version, ensuring spatial compatibility with Sentinel-2 images.

2. Visualisation  
  Plot the CLCPlus labels to verify class distribution and spatial alignment.

3. Training dataset structure  
  Discover the directory structure containing all label files corresponding to the Sentinel-2 images used for training.

4. Automation **optional**  
  Provide reproducible code to automatically download all CLCPlus labels required for the training dataset.
