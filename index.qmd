# Introduction {.unnumbered}

What is the project about? What data, what methods, what skills?
What is a satellite image ? What is a segmentation mask for satellite image ?

# Structure of the project

This project has five steps (listed in the banner at the top of the page):

- data acquisition;
- model training and evaluation;
- inference and statistics;
- deployment.

# Initialization of the project

## Clone the project with `Git` {{< fa brands git-alt >}}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Attention

[Vscode-python](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python).

Create a VScode service on SSP Cloud. In the service, open a terminal by clicking on {{< fa brands fa-bars >}}, then `Terminal > New Terminal`. Clone the project repository with:

```         
git clone https://github.com/AIML4OS/funathon-project3.git
```

Structure of the project:

-   The `.qmd` files and the `_quarto.yaml` file are necessary to build the website ;
-   The file `pyproject.toml` describes the dependencies of the project ;
-   Intermediate solutions to the exercices are available in the `intermediate_solutions` folder; 
-   The final solution is available in the `final_solution` folder;

## Installation of dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```         
uv sync
```
